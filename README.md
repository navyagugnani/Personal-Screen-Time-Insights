# Personal-Screen-Time-Insights | Python
This project is designed to explore a user's screen time habits using Python. It delves into identifying the specific apps and websites accessed, along with the duration of usage for each. The analysis and visual representation of the data are carried out using powerful libraries like pandas, numpy, and visualization tools such as plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects.
